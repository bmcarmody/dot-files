# Dot-Files

:wave: Welcome to my setup! Here, you'll find all of the configurations for the tools I use for web development
and general programming. I use these tools on a daily basis, both for personal
and professional development.

This development environment uses a combination of powerful tools and plugins to
enhance my developer productivity. Some of the key components are Tmux and
Alacritty. I have these tools setup to work seamlessly together to provide an efficient
and powerful development setup, all without me having to take my hands off the
keyboard!

I've put a lot of time and effort into creating this so feel free to take inspriation!

**Note** - My Neovim config has it's own repository (https://github.com/bmcarmody/nvim_config) Feel free to check that out as well!

## Requirements

Just so I don't forget how to get this all working next time I get a new laptop

**Tmux** - `brew install tmux`

**Tpm** (Packer manager for tmux) - https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm

**Alacritty** - https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/INSTALL.md

**Fira Code Nerd Font** - https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and migrate the files to your `$HOME` directory - ensure
   that you don't have any duplicate files as this might override their configurations
2. Open a tmux session - `tmux`
3. Install tmux plugins by entering `<C-a>I`
4. :tada: Enjoy all the power that rests at your fingertips
